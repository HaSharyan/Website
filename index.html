            <p class="about">
                Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that
                originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from a
                combination of African-American genres such as blues, boogie-woogie, jump blues, jazz, and gospel
                music, together with Western swing and country music. Though elements of rock and roll can
                be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did
                not acquire its name until the 1950s.
                "Rock and roll" can refer either to the first wave of music that originated in the US in the
                1950s prior to its development into "rock music", or more broadly to rock music and culture.
                For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.
                In the earliest rock and roll styles of the late 1940s and early 1950s, either the piano or
                saxophone was often the lead instrument, but these were generally replaced or supplemented by
                guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a blues rhythm with an accentuated
                backbeat, the latter almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually
                played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm), a string bass or (after the mid-1950s
                ) an electric bass guitar, and a drum kit.
                Beyond simply a musical style, rock and roll, as seen in movies and on television, influenced lifestyles,
                fashion, attitudes, and language. In addition, rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights
                movement because both African-American and white American teens enjoyed the music. It went on to
                spawn various genres, often without the initially characteristic backbeat, that are now more commonly
                called simply "rock music" or "rock".

            <p class="about">
                Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of
                rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely
                popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word "alternative" refers to the genre's
                distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to
                a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply
                the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for
                alternative music. At times, "alternative" has been used as a catch-all description for music
                from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock
                or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as
                well as new wave, and post-punk).

            <p class="about">
                Hard rock or heavy rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s,
                with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive
                vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.
                Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands such as Led Zeppelin,
                The Who, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, AC/DC and Van Halen. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved
                away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others began to return to a
                hard rock sound. Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial
                peak in the 1980s, with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of
                Guns N' Roses, which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade. Hard rock
                began losing popularity with the commercial success of grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s.
                Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a
                renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged
                from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the
                1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.

            <header> <h1> Metal Rock </h1> </header>
            <p class="about">
                Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and
                early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock
                and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound,
                characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall
                loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with masculinity,
                aggression, and machismo.
                The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large
                audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status common throughout the history of
                the genre. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding
                much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing
                emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such
                as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans
                became known as "metalheads" or "headbangers".

            <p class="about">
                Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted
                and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling
                vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques,
                minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions
                . The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion
                (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy,
                science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation,
                dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.
                Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged
                during the mid-1980s. Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important
                influences on the genre's creation. Possessed] and Death, along with bands such
                as Obituary, Autopsy and Morbid Angel, are often considered pioneers of the genre.
                In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular genre niche
                record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner, began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.]
